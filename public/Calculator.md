Our second assignment for web development was to create a calculator using Vue. As I already had 
designed this very website an preparation for this class, this was a trivial task. I have, for 
simplicity, chosen to use the javascript *eval()* function which is the reason why the calculator 
dosent function on my website. This function could allow a user with enough knowledge to execute 
any javascript code on my website, something I naturally would like to avoid.

**Note: Calculator is non-functional on this website**
